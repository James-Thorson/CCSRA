#' Catch curve stock reduction analysis
#'
#' CCSRA is an age-structured stock assessment modelling package built in TMB
#'
#' CCSRA is desired to implement catch-curve analysis, stock-reduction analysis, age-structured models, age-structured production models, and catch-curve stock reduction analysis.  It is intended to facilitate learning and simulation-testing across multiple model types, particularly when comparing mixed-effect and penalized-likelihood implementations.
